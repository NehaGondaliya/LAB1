# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This Python program generates the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence based on user input.

## **What is the Fibonacci Sequence?**
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting with `0` and `1`. The sequence grows as follows:

**0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...**

### **Key Properties**
1. Starts with `0` and `1`.
2. Each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers:
   - 0 + 1 = 1
   - 1 + 1 = 2
   - 1 + 2 = 3
   - 2 + 3 = 5, and so on.

### **Program Description**
This script takes a user-defined number (`n`) as input and generates the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

For example:

Enter the number of Fibonacci terms to generate: 5
The first 5 terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
